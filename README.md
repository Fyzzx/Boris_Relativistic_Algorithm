# Boris_Relativistic_Algorithm
Algorithm for solving the Lorentz force equations and tracking position and time of a relativistic particle (coded in MATLAB). 
Uses the Boris method and explores the motion for 3 different 2 step magnetic field rotations. 

2 files are uploaded. 

The first, BorisA_RelChargedParticle.m, uses the Boris algorithm with no approximation made for small angle rotations

The second, BorisComparison_RelChargedParticle.m, compares the results from 3 types of Boris algorithms as discussed in the following 2018 paper 
"On the Boris solver in particle-in-cell simulation" by Seiji Zenitani and Takayuki Umeda (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5051077)
